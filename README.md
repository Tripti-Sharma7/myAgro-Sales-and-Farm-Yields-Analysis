# myAgro Sales and Farm Yields Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze key variables affecting myAgro's sales and farmers' yields. By comparing high-yield groups with low-yield ones, we aim to provide valuable insights that can help myAgro improve its services and sales strategy. Our motivation is to bring financial stability to smallholder farmers and facilitate their access to essential farming resources. In this project, we are collaborating with myAgro's analysts and data scientists to drive impactful results.
